<h2>About the Site</h2>
<p>This site has been built to share my love of Rugby with you, my inspiration came about in the most recent <a href ="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/" target="_blank">Rugby world cup</a>and how little people knew of the sport. My goal here is to get gather some more interest and possibly get some more people playing the sport. If you are interested in playing there is a short form to fill out to see what position you could play.To really get a good understanding of the position you are just going to have to try it out!&nbsp;<strong>Be warned! Rugby is not for the faint of heart!</strong>.So if the idea of tackling somebody or being tackled in the mud doesn't sound like fun to you this may not be your sport.</p>

<h3>The History of Rugby</h3>
<p>Rugby is said to have originated in Rugby school, Warwickshire, England in the year 1823. During a game of football William Webb Ellis picked up a ball and started running with it. Though this is a myth the world cup is named the William Web Ellis cup. The first world cup was only played in 1987 with New Zealand the ultimate winners. The world cup is played every 4 years. New Zealand, South Africa have won it 3 times, Australia 2 and England the only northern hemisphere team to win it with 1.
